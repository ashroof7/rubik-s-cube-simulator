Rubik's cube simulator using OpenGL 3.3+ 

controls 
--------
the controls are pretty hard (just to apply rotation)

> (q,w,e), (a,s,d) --> rotation around x axis in both CW, and CCW
> (r,t,y), (f,g,h) --> rotation around y axis in both CW, and CCW
> (u,i,o), (j,k,l) --> rotation around z axis in both CW, and CCW
> '`' produces one random move
